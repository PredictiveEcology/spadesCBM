# Overview  {-}

:::{.rmdimportant}
This documentation is work in progress. Potential discrepancies and omissions may exist for the time being. If you find any, contact us [here]("https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM/issues").
:::

[spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) is a modular, transparent, and spatially explicit implementation of the logic, pools structure, equations, and default assumptions of the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector ([CBM](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-accounting/carbon-budget-model/13107)). It applies the science presented in @kurz2009 in a similar way to the simulations in @boisvenue2016 and @boisvenue2022 but calls Python functions for annual processes (see [libcbm_py/examples/cbm_exn](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/tree/main/examples/cbm_exn)). These functions and [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) are, like much of modelling-based science, continuously under development.

The collection of [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) modules in [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) was developed to enable R&D input to the Canadian Forest Service ([CFS](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-budget-model)) forest carbon reporting system, [NFCMARS](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/forest-carbon/canada-s-forest-carbon-reporting-system), the National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting, and Reporting system. The CFS provides science backing for Canadian policies on national forest issues. [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) is a nimble tool in which new science, data and algorithms can be tested and explored to serve policy purposes. [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) development follows the [PERFICT](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#basic-structure-of-a-spades-project) approach of @mcintire2022 for ecological modelling systems, an approach that helps solve many of the complex issues in ecological modelling, supports continuous workflows, and nimble, enter operable modelling systems. The [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) platform is the toolkit that enables this implementation of the [PERFICT](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#basic-structure-of-a-spades-project) principle.

## Usage {-}

Four [modules](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#modules) need to be run in tandem for a [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulation. 
The first module, [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git), reads in defaults CBM parameters for Canada. The second module, [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git), is a data preparation SpaDES module, where input data and spatial layers are assembled and prepared for a specific study area. The [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) module will be study-area and scenario specific. 
Throughout this manual we use an example simulation of forest carbon dynamics for the managed forests of Saskatchewan (SK) from 1985-2011 similarly to the simulations in @boisvenue2016, where the *SK* indicates the study area.
In [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git), as in CBM, growth curves ($m^3/ha$) are the main change-agent. 
The [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git) module translates user-provided stand-level growth curves ($m^3/ha$) into increments for specific above ground carbon pools (metric tonnes of carbon/ha) using @boudewyn2007 models (leading species specific) to which we added a smoothing algorithm to fill-in the gap between age 0 and the age at which growth curves have data. 
Note that [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git) is also study-area specific, as @boudewyn2007 parameters are dominant species and [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#ecozone-vs-spatial-unit) specific. 

[CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git), and [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git) have one [event](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#events) (`init`), and need to be run only once (note that they will be [cached](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/Caching.html) in our example). [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) processes most of the data in its `init` event, but also has a second event where the annual disturbances are processed (`readDisturbanceEvents`). This second event enables dynamic linkages to disturbance models. 
These three modules provide the inputs to the [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module, where carbon-transfers between pools are applied on a specified time step (in our example, yearly). 
This modularity enables users to access and change default parameters, change inputs, connect dynamically to external modules that modify the landscape, and assess the impact of these changes. 
We are working on various implementations of this modelling system and making these available to the community in the [Preditive Ecology](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology) GitHub repository.
We hope others will do the same. 
A smaller study area extent simulation of [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) is available in the [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) [training manual](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/spadesCBMDemo.html).

Several core utilities to [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) are provided by the [`CBMutils`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/development) package, available on GitHub. The [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) platform has a much broader scope than our use of it in [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git). We provide some basic [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) definitions [here](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) so that users can perform [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulations without having to learn all the [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) capacities. [`CBMutils`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/development) functions used in our example and mentioned in thsi manual will have links to their code and/or documentation. Active development in [`CBMutils`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/development) and all [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) modules is underway.

## The Carbon Budget Model in SpaDES {-}

The Carbon Budget Model ([CBM](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-accounting/carbon-budget-model/13107)) was first developed in the early 1990s (@kurz1993). Its implementation in a platform for model inter-operability and nimbleness such as [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) warrants an overview. 

[spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulates forest carbon dynamics for a given study area based on Canadian-parameterization and user-provided growth and inventory information. Default Canadian parameters are read-in ([CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git)), matched to the user-provided information ([CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) and [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git)), and this information drives the carbon-transfers through the simulations ([CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git)).

### Input requirements {-}

[spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulations require study area information, age, and leading species of each stand or pixel to simulate on the landscape, and growth information for each stand or pixel. Users can provide this information in various format which is processed in [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) and in [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git). We suggest users modify the example provided to represent their study area and inventory information. Each module has a chapter in which module inputs and outputs are listed.

### Pools {-}

There are 18 internal carbon pools in [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git), representing a stand or pixel (Table 1), and two pools that take carbon out of the system, Products and the Atmosphere. The carbon transfers are dictated by matrices (available in [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git)) which specify the proportion of carbon moving between two pools ([source_pool](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#source_pool-and-sink_pool) to a [sink_pools](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#source_pool-and-sink_pool)). Matrices for growth are populated with the user-provided growth information and are the main change agent in the system, providing carbon input to the stand. Default parameters for biomass and dead organic mater (DOM) turnover, decay, and soil mixing are either at the provincial/territorial, ecozone, or Canada-wide scale (see Table 1 in @kurz2009). Note that parameters can easily be modified from their defaults in a [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulation. Disturbances matrices representing carbon-transfers during disturbances like fire or harvesting, are available in the defaults (read-in via [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git)) for all managed forests of Canada.

### Order of operations {-}

In simulations, disturbances occur before any other carbon transfer. After the disturbances, half of the growth (determined by increments in the user-provided growth curve) is applied followed by the transfers representing DOM turnover, live biomass turnover, an overmature decline compensation if applicable, the 2nd half of the growth, DOM decay, slow decay and slow soil mixing. As previously stated, carbon additions to the system come from the atmosphere (amount determined by growth via user-provided growth curves), and carbon exits the system to the atmosphere or to the forest products sector.

*Figure 2: Carbon pools and transfers diagram in spadesCBM*

Transfers are proportions of a source pool to sink pools and proportions add up to 1, so no carbon is lost.

*Table 2: Types of carbon transfers in spadesCBM*

| Carbon Transfers |
|------------------|
| disturbance |
| half growth |
| domturnover |
| bioturnover |
| overmaturedecline |
| 2nd half of the growth |
| domdecay |
| slowdecay |
| slowmixing |

### The `spinup` function {-}

The amount of carbon below ground in forests is extremely variable and consequently there are few data that can provide this information at scales greater then plot levels. To compensate for this gap in knowledge and data, prior to a simulation, [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) completes a process that populates below ground pools. This process is called a **spinup** and it is the first [event](SpaDES speak) in the [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module. The procedure consists of growing and burning forest stand, according to the provided growth curves and default values for fire return intervals (provided in [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git)) until the below ground carbon pool stabilize the aboveground slow (in the soil organic layer) and belowground slow (mineral soil) pools reach a quasi-equilibrium state when the difference between the sum of the pools’ C stocks at the end of two successive rotations is ≤0.1% or reach a predefined number of simulations. Once this state has been reached, one last simulation of the spin-up completes the initialization. In the last simulation the most recent stand-replacing disturbance, as defined by the inventory record, is applied to the stand, and the model grows the forest stand to the current age, also defined in the inventory record. The choice of a fire disturbance to recreate existing conditions matches the historical forest disturbance for most forests in Canada. We consider this procedure a place holder until our knowledge of below ground carbon dynamics improves. Although it will likely be resulting in errors in absolute carbon stocks (see @boisvenue2022 Appendix 4), these should be systematic errors and we can at least simulate the trends in carbon stocks and fluxes. Research has compared below ground stocks values (@shaw2008) and work continues to improve parameters (@hararuk2017).
