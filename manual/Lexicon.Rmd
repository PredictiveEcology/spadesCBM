# Lexicon {-}

If this is your first time encountering a model built within the SpaDES framework, you may be unfamiliar with several terms used in this manual. Here we offer a lexicon to help familiarize users with terms and concepts relevant to spadesCBM. A more comprehensive guide and introduction to robust and nimble scientific workflows using SpaDES can be found [here](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/).

## Basic SpaDES concepts {-}
### Basic structure of a SpaDES project {-}

SpaDES projects aim to follow the principles of repeatability, reproducibility, reusability, and transparency.  
Using modules allows us to break up a model's code into meaningful themes and/or uses that can easily be moved, swapped or replaced. SpaDES projects use modules in its standardized structure to allow for this nimbleness. In it's most basic form, each module defines its own metadata, identifying the inputs and outputs of the code, allowing R to connect the module with others.

#### Modules {-}
In its simplest form, a SpaDES module is comprised of R code that has metadata that gets put into functions.

##### Metadata {-}

##### Events {-}

##### .inputObjects() {-}

#### Simlist {-}

### Running a global script {-}
#### setupProject() {-}

#### simInitAndSpades2() {-}

#### Folder structure of a SpaDES module {-}
Our spadesCBM modules use the basic folder structure for all SpaDES modules. Each have their respective `.R` scripts, an `.Rmd` file with their documentation used in this manual, and a `tests` folder containing the module's tests. Some will also have an `R` folder containing other scripts that get sourced when running the module. These can include basic functions used in the module or the creation of default objects only used when the user doesn't provide a specific input.
