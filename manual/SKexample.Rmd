# Example: spadesCBM in Saskatchewan {-}
Here we provide an example script to run a small area of managed forests in Saskatchewan between 1985 and 2020. This example is fairly lightweight and most computers should be able to run the simulation. If you have access to the computing power, the entirety of managed forests in Saskatchewan can also be run using this [script](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM/blob/main/globalSK.R). Note while the example provided here can run on most computers, running the entire province requires >75 Gbs of RAM to run. 

In this example, we setup the workflow using the
[`SpaDES.project`](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/) package and
current versions of the [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) modules.


## Setup {-}
A few things need to be set up the first time running spadesCBM. While the global script below will take care and guide you through most of these, here are some things to note during the initial set up. 

### Google account {-}

To run the provided example, users need to access some of the data using the [googledrive](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/googledrive/index.html) R package (part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of R packages). 
During the [simInit()](https://spades-core.predictiveecology.org/reference/simInit.html) (or [simInitAndSpades](https://rdrr.io/cran/SpaDES.core/man/simInitAndSpades.html)) call, a function to initialize (or initialize and run) [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org)-based simulations, R will prompt you to either choose a previously authenticated account (if you have previously used [googledrive](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/googledrive/index.html)) or to open a browser window and authenticate. 

Make sure you give [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) read/write access to your files:

### Python {-}

The [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module, which is the simulation module of [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git), requires Python >=3.9 and <=3.12.7.

If a suitable version of Python does not already exist on your computer,
The [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package will be used to install it using the [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).

If you are using a Windows computer with Git installed, the [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) tool will be acquired and managed directly by [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). If you are using a Windows computer without Git installed, you will be prompted to allow the [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) tool to be downloaded directly from Github to your local user application data directory (`tools::R_user_dir("CBMutils")`).

If the Python installation process fails or you would prefer to manually install Python, it can be downloaded directly from [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads). The calls to Python are for functions from a package called [libcbm](https://cat-cfs.github.io/libcbm_py/). Python functions are only used in the [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module. Details on [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module and the Python functions are provided in [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) chapter in this manual.

  
## Running the simulation {-}
  
Here is an R script to run the simulation of forest carbon dynamics in a small area in the managed forests of SK from 1985 to 2020, with disturbances as presented in @boisvenue2016. Depending on your computing capacity, this may take a while, particularly the first time you run it. Subsequent simulations are much faster because of the use of the [reproducible::Cache](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SpaDES.core/vignettes/iii-cache.html) function.

The simulation period can be changed to be shorter, but disturbances raster are only provided for years within the 1985-2011 range in this example.

## Viewing results {-}
Once the simulation has run, we can view our results. Some of these are saved as files in the outputs folder created in the project's directory. If kept as the default in the global script above, these can be found here: `~/GitHub/spadesCBM/outputs`. You should be able to see `.rds` files for cbmPools and NPP for each simulated year, as well as various growth curve and increment related figures from [CBM_vol2biomass_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass_SK) shown below.

The `simMngedSK` object in R is the resulting [simlist](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#simlist) of our simulation. `CBMutils` offers a few plotting functions to help visualize basic results using our simlist.

# Yearly forest products and emissions for each simulation year
